"""state.py — LangGraph state definition for the journal agent.

JournalState is a TypedDict that every node reads from and writes to.
Fields annotated with ``add`` or ``add_messages`` are *append-reducers*:
each node returns a partial dict and LangGraph merges it into the
accumulated state using the annotated reducer function.
