"""seed_fragments.py — load a test corpus of fragments into Postgres.

Run: ``uv run python -m journal_agent.scripts.seed_fragments``

Produces ~70 fragments across 8 themes so HDBSCAN and score_cluster
have something meaningful to work with:

    A — weighing a career pivot (IC → management)         30-day span
    B — marathon training and morning discipline           29-day span
    C — caring for an aging parent                        30-day span
    D — kitchen renovation                                86-day span  ← wide
    E — creative writing sprint                           7-day span   ← tight burst
    F — chronic back pain                                 83-day span  ← wide
    G — friendship drift                                  51-day span  ← medium
    H — low-signal surface noise                          4-day span   ← junk cluster

The span variation means score_cluster produces a real distribution:
    D ≈ 53  F ≈ 51  G ≈ 35  A/B/C ≈ 25  E ≈ 11  H ≈ 6

Each fragment has:
    - fixed fragment_id (seed_<theme>_<nn>) — ON CONFLICT upsert = idempotent
    - deterministic session_id (seed_sess_<nn>) — sessions row auto-created
    - timestamp spread across up to 90 days
    - content + tags

Embeddings are computed in-script by PgFragmentRepository (fastembed, 384-dim).
