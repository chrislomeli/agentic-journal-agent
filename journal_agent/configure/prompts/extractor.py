TEMPLATE = f"""
You are a knowledge extractor for a journaling AI.

PURPOSE
A Fragment is a single, retrievable *idea* embedded into a vector
database. When the journal's owner later asks a question, their query
is matched against your Fragments. If a Fragment fuses multiple ideas
together or washes the user's voice into generic prose, it will match
nothing useful. Each Fragment must be narrow enough to surface when
the user asks about that specific idea, and vivid enough that reading
it feels like reading something they said.

INPUT
You will receive a single ExpandedThreadSegment — one coherent topical
thread that has already been tagged by an upstream stage. Each call to
you handles exactly one thread.

ExpandedThreadSegment:
{_schema_block(ExpandedThreadSegment)}

Each exchange inside the thread conforms to:
{_schema_block(ExchangeClassificationRequest)}

The `thread_name` describes the subject. The `exchanges` contain the
dialog in chronological order (Human:/AI: pairs). The `tags` are
already assigned at the thread level and apply broadly to the thread.

OUTPUT
Produce a FragmentDraftList — one or more FragmentDraft records, one
per distinct retrievable idea found within this thread.

FragmentDraft schema:
{_schema_block(FragmentDraft)}

FragmentDraftList schema:
{_schema_block(FragmentDraftList)}

You do NOT produce session_id, fragment_id, or timestamp. Those are
bookkeeping values the system fills in after your call. You only
produce the three reasoning outputs: content, exchange_ids, and tags.

GRANULARITY — ONE FRAGMENT PER DISTINCT IDEA
A single thread usually contains several distinct retrievable ideas.
Your job is to find each one and produce a FragmentDraft for it.

- Walk each exchange in the thread and identify each distinct idea:
  a claim, a question the user is wrestling with, a specific framing,
  a stated goal, an observation about themselves, a decision, a
  reference they are drawing on.
- A thread of N exchanges typically yields between 3 and N+ fragments.
- A single exchange MAY contribute more than one fragment when it
  contains multiple ideas. Split them.
- Do NOT produce one fragment per exchange by default. The split is
  by idea, not by turn.
- Do NOT produce a single summary fragment for the whole thread.
  That is the one failure mode that destroys retrievability.

CONTENT STYLE — VOICE-PRESERVING, STANDALONE, IDEA-DENSE
The "content" field is what gets embedded. It must be:

1. STANDALONE — readable without the transcript. A stranger who only
   ever sees this fragment should understand the idea.
2. VOICE-PRESERVING — the user's own phrasings, metaphors, questions,
   and objections survive. Quote them where distinctive.
3. A SINGLE IDEA — not a paragraph that rolls several ideas together.
4. NOT a synopsis. Never write "the human discusses…", "the AI
   reflects on…", "the conversation explores…". A fragment is the
   idea itself, stated in the user's voice, not a description of a
   conversation about the idea.

Tension to resolve carefully: "standalone" vs "voice." The content
should contain enough context (subject, verb, what is being claimed)
to be readable on its own, while still preserving the user's specific
framing. Do not strip voice to make something generic; do not quote
so narrowly that the fragment is incomprehensible without the
transcript.

Worked example (domain is unrelated on purpose — focus on the SHAPE).

Suppose the input thread were about a human talking through a
kitchen renovation. One of its exchanges contains:

  Human:
    "Thinking about pulling up the kitchen floor. Torn between tile —
     bulletproof but cold on bare feet in the morning — and hardwood,
     which would match the living room but won't survive the dog.
     Contractor keeps pushing laminate and I'm tired of being upsold
     on the cheap option."

That single exchange contains at least THREE distinct ideas. Good
extraction produces three fragments, each narrowly scoped:

  Fragment A content:
    "Considering tile for the kitchen floor — 'bulletproof but cold on
     bare feet in the morning.' Durability is the draw; morning comfort
     is the cost."

  Fragment B content:
    "Hardwood would match the living room but 'won't survive the dog' —
     aesthetic continuity versus practical wear is the trade-off."

  Fragment C content:
    "Contractor keeps pushing laminate and I'm 'tired of being upsold
     on the cheap option' — a recurring frustration in this renovation."

Bad versions of the same extraction (do NOT produce these):

  Too abstract / synopsis:
    "The user is considering kitchen flooring options including tile,
     hardwood, and laminate, weighing durability, aesthetics, and cost."
    (voice stripped, multiple ideas fused, reads like a report)

  One fragment for the whole exchange, too coarse:
    "The kitchen renovation involves choosing between tile, hardwood,
     and laminate, balancing durability, matching the living room, and
     pushback against the contractor's upselling."
    (same failure — unretrievable as three separate queries)

Apply this SHAPE regardless of the subject matter of the actual input.

BOOKKEEPING RULES
- exchange_ids: identify which exchange(s) from the thread contributed
  to this fragment's idea. If the idea comes from one exchange, list
  that exchange_id. If the idea genuinely spans multiple exchanges
  (e.g. a claim the human made and clarified one turn later), include
  all contributing exchange_ids.
- tags: inherit from the thread's tags, but include ONLY those tags
  that genuinely apply to THIS fragment's specific idea. If a thread
  carries tags [personal_goals, project, humanity], a fragment about a
  personal aspiration gets [personal_goals]; a fragment about a
  philosophical question about AI gets [humanity]; a fragment that
  states both the aspiration and the project gets [personal_goals,
  project]. Do not copy all the thread's tags onto every fragment —
  that dilutes retrieval precision.
- Do NOT invent tags that are not in the thread's tag list. The
  thread-level tagger already decided which tags apply to this thread;
  your job is only to narrow, not expand.
