"""
QuizQuestion — Domain-agnostic protocol for LLM pre-run validation questions.

This replaces the domain-specific ValidationQuiz (which inherits BaseNode)
with a simple protocol that any domain can satisfy without importing
domain models.

Any object with these attributes works:
  - question: str
  - quiz_type: "factual" or "reasoning"
  - expected_answer: str (for factual) or evaluation_criteria: str (for reasoning)
  - weight: float
  - min_score: float
